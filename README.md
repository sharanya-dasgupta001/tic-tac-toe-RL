# tic-tac-toe-RL
- This project involves developing an AI-driven Tic-Tac-Toe model using Reinforcement Learning (RL).
- The model learns optimal strategies by playing multiple games, adjusting its decisions based on rewards.
- We have utilized Q-learning and the Monte Carlo method to train the agents, enabling them to refine their strategies over time.
